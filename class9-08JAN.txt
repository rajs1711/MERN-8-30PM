=====  Javascript Modules =========

As our programme size grow , it contains many lines of 
code , rather than keeping everything in a single file , we
can use the concept of modules.

By the help of modules you can seperate your code a/c to
functionalities in multiple file.

Benifit:  Organized , Easy to Maintain , Less Buggy . 

Note: we can have only one deafult export in a file.
      the method which is deafult exported can import in anothe file 
      by any random name and with out curly 
      

ES6 : module  => react 
common js : node js => but node js module
